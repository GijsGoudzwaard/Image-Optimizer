# Instead of manually specifying a long list of build and runtime dependencies,
# we can use a convenient pre-made runtime and SDK. For this example, we'll be
# using the runtime and SDK provided by elementary.
runtime: io.elementary.Platform

sdk: io.elementary.Sdk

# This should match the exec line in your .desktop file and usually is the same
# as your app ID

# Here we can specify the kinds of permissions our app needs to run. Since we're
# not using hardware like webcams, making sound, or reading external files, we
# only need permission to draw our app on screen using either X11 or Wayland.

# This section is where you list all the source code required to build your app.
# If we had external dependencies that weren't included in our SDK, we would list
